## 🚀 Quick Start

**Install security controls in your project:**

```bash
# Download installer and checksum
curl -O https://github.com/h4x0r/1-click-github-sec/releases/download/v0.4.14/install-security-controls.sh
curl -O https://github.com/h4x0r/1-click-github-sec/releases/download/v0.4.14/checksums.txt

# VERIFY checksum before execution (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED - critical security practice)
sha256sum -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing

# Install
chmod +x install-security-controls.sh
./install-security-controls.sh
```

**That's it!** Your project now has comprehensive security controls.

## 🔐 Security Verification

**Every release is cryptographically signed:**

```bash
# Verify release authenticity
git tag -v v0.4.14

# Expected output:
# gitsign: Good signature from [albert@securityronin.com]
# Validated Git signature: true
# Validated Rekor entry: true
```

All commits and releases are signed with [Sigstore](https://sigstore.dev/) and logged in the [Rekor transparency ledger](https://rekor.sigstore.dev/) for public verification.

## 📊 This Repository vs Your Project

This repository demonstrates "dogfooding plus" - it uses enhanced security controls beyond what it installs:

| Feature | What Installer Gives You | What This Repository Has |
|---------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Pre-push Controls** | 24 universal security checks | 24 security checks + 5 development-specific |
| **CI/CD Workflows** | Optional installation | 6 specialized development workflows |
| **GitHub Security** | Automated setup | Enhanced with custom policies |
| **Documentation** | Installation guides | Complete documentation site + development controls documentation |
| **Cryptographic Signing** | Optional setup | All commits & releases signed |

**Bottom line:** We use an enhanced version of what we provide to others, proving it works in production.
